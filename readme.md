pyTenable is a library designed to provide a simple & easy-to-understand library into the Tenable product APIs.  Currently the library is under active development and new componentry is being added & changed to fit the evolving needs, requirements, and desires for the end-goal of the library.

**WARNING:** Currently in an alpha state and may change over time.

**NOTE:** As of v0.2, paths for the sub-packages have changed slightly.  This was done to improve readability as lengthy imports are always a pain.

* `tenable.tenable_io` is now `tenable.io`
* `tenable.securitycenter` is now `tenable.sc`
* `tenable.container_security` is now `tenable.cs`
