# pyTenable

pyTenable is a library designed to provide a simple & easy-to-understand library into the Tenable product APIs.  Currently the library is under active development and new componentry is being added & changed to fit the evolving needs, requirements, and desires for the end-goal of the library.

**WARNING:** Currently in a pre-alpha state and not suitable for general consumption yet.

Further Documentation will be forthcoming once the library is further down the line.

## TODO:

## Tenable.io package

- bulk-operations endpoints should be interlaced into the relevant APIEndpoints
- _check should support multiple object types for checking
- _check should allow for passing a checking function for further validation.
  + Example would be validating filters.
