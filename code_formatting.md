# Code Formating Guidelines

* All modules should generally follow Google Style DocStrings 
  [example](http://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html).
* Conform to PEP8 as best as possible.
* Code readability is paramount (if something is complicated, then we want to break it down into readable & manageable components)
* Code should be commented not only to describe what it is, but should also tell the story of what we are doing and why.
* We should avoid complicating code beyond whats necessary.
* We should generally try to conform to DRY when appropriate.
* All classes should be CamelCase
* Function names and variables should use underscore notation, AKA Snake case, like `snake_case`.
